            <p>Currently, the world is facing a global health crisis unlike any other — COVID-19 is spreading human suffering, destabilizing the global economy and upending the lives of billions of people around the globe. Health emergencies such as COVID-19 pose a global risk and have shown the critical need for preparedness. </p>

            <p>Education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is a key to escaping poverty. Due to COVID-19, never before have so many children been out of school at the same time, disrupting learning and upending lives, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized. </p>

            <p>Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. Despite recent gains, many challenges remain: women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership, and 1 in 5 women and girls report experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a 12-month period.</p>

            <p>Sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve living standards.

            <p>The world is becoming increasingly urbanized. Since 2007, more than half the world’s population has been living in cities, and that share is projected to rise to 60 per cent by 2030. Cities and metropolitan areas are powerhouses of economic growth—however, they also account for about 70 per cent of global carbon emissions and over 60 per cent of resource use. </p>

            <p>2019 was the second warmest year on record and the end of the warmest decade ever recorded.  Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere rose to new records in 2019. Climate change is affecting every country on every continent.

            <p>The ocean drives global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind. Our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food, and even the oxygen in the air we breathe, are all ultimately provided and regulated by the sea.

            <p>Nature is critical to our survival: nature provides us with our oxygen, regulates our weather patterns, pollinates our crops, produces our food, feed and fiber. But it is under increasing stress. Human activity has altered almost 75 per cent of the earth’s surface, squeezing wildlife and nature into an ever-smaller corner of the planet.</p>
