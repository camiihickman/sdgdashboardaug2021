      <h2 id="1">Race and Income</h2>
        <p>Wealth across the National Capital Area is concentrated geographically— and also racially. Mean per capita income, disaggregated by race, presents a compelling visual when mapped across Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. As of 2016, the median household income for Black and African American residents in DC is <a href="https://www.dcfpi.org/all/economic-inequality-in-dc-reflects-disparities-in-income-wages-wealth-and-economic-mobility-policy-solutions-should-too/">less than one third</a> of the median household income for white residents. Poverty is dictated by a number of factors, including access to gainful employment and regional cost of living. Accounting for why a larger percentage of Black families in DC live in poverty than in Maryland cannot be reduced merely to the high cost of living in the District — one of the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/10/americas-10-most-expensive-states-to-live-in-2019.html">most expensive cities</a> in the country. Race and income are inextricably linked to one another, and to urban planning — our modern day communities are the <a href="https://medium.com/una-nca-snapshots/building-inclusive-cities-sustainable-urban-development-7cdacb3eb736">legacies</a> of patterns of disinvestment, gentrification, and exclusionary housing policy. This leaves us in a reality where higher-income families are predominantly white and are concentrated within the same neighborhoods and, by extension, counties or Wards. The inverse is the concentration of poverty in urban and suburban regions. Our team hypothesizes that whiter neighborhoods are wealthier in part due to greater proximity to gainful employment — the <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/racial-wage-gaps-persistence-poses-challenge.aspx">racial pay gap</a> is well documented and in part <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/">linked</a> to implicit racial and gender biases among employers and that lower shares of Black and Hispanic residents are college educated (more on why in <a href="../goal4/index.html">SDG 4</a>). However, there needs to be further investigation into the opportunity gap, wherein bias, education, and geography coalesce to shape both the demographics and wealth gaps in our communities. </p>

        <h2 id="2">Homelessness</h2>
        <blockquote>“Homelessness is an experience, not a characteristic. While the numbers behind the causes of homelessness don’t tell us exactly how many people experience homelessness...they do explain why the economic landscape makes homelessness likely for so many.”
    </blockquote><a class="attribution" href="https://www.hchmd.org/homelessness-baltimore">The Journey Home: Baltimore’s Plan to Make Homelessness Rare and Brief</a></p>

<p>As of 2019, nearly 17% of DC residents lived in poverty, with over 6,500 people experiencing homelessness— <a href="https://www.missiondc.org/learn/about-homelessness/">twice</a> the national average. Low wages, high cost of living, and inadequate access and distribution of affordable housing are all critical causes— and the true impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear. The most recent numbers reported by the <a href="https://www.usich.gov/homelessness-statistics/dc/">US Interagency Council on Homelessness</a> estimate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Total Homeless Population: 6,500</li>
  <li>Total Family Households Experiencing Homelessness: 770</li>
  <li>Veterans Experiencing Homelessness: 300</li>
  <li>Persons Experiencing Chronic Homelessness: 1450</li>
  <li>Unaccompanied Young Adults (18-24) Experiencing Homelessness: 250</li>
</ul>
  <p>‘<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218239/">Homelessness</a>’ refers to an individual or family lacking access to stable, safe, or permanent housing— and each experience is unique. There is an even larger population of students living at least part of the year “<a href="https://edsource.org/2021/california-schools-report-fewer-homeless-students-alarming-advocates/647675">on the street, in cars, shelters, motels, or ‘doubled up’ with other families in houses or apartments.</a>” In DC, this includes nearly 7,500 children, with over 1,800 students living in shelters and just under 5,000 ‘doubled up.’ </p>
  <p>Homelessness is a nuanced issue. Among women, a primary factor is escaping domestic violence—<a href="https://www.thrivedc.org/8840-2/">over 90%</a> of homeless women nationally are survivors of physical or sexual abuse. In DC, women stay in shelters for an average of <a href="https://nlchp.org">27 days</a>, slipping in and out of homelessness.</p>
  <h3>Share of the Population that is Experiencing Homelessness (2021)</h3>
  <img class="body graph" src="img/1-2-1-figure-1.png" alt="table of homelessness data for local counties">
  <p>According to the <a href="https://nlchp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Homeless_Stats_Fact_Sheet.pdf">National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty</a>, insufficient income and lack of affordable housing are the leading causes of homelessness nationally. Low income households—typically unemployed or underemployed— do not earn enough to pay for food, clothing, transportation and housing. This can be due to a number of <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/what-causes-homelessness/incomeinequality/">factors</a>: challenging labor market, limited education, gap in work history, criminal record, unreliable transportation, poor health or disability. These individuals or families are then up against a large-scale affordable housing crisis, wherein the supply of low-cost housing has shrunk nationally. Across DC, Maryland, and Virginia, housing developments are booming— but are almost <a href="https://wamu.org/story/18/10/24/isnt-affordable-housing-d-c-area/">exclusively</a> luxury apartments. DC has approximately <a href="https://wamu.org/story/18/10/24/isnt-affordable-housing-d-c-area/">three times</a> more affordable housing units than Montgomery County, but the challenge is that subsidized units are <a href="https://www.streetsensemedia.org/article/cog-dc-rent-moratorium-housing/#.YQCz1y1h2BI">heavily concentrated</a> in areas without reliable access to transportation, employment opportunities, healthy foods, and comprehensive healthcare. This ultimately traps people in cycles of poverty—and homelessness—while the national availability of low income housing continues to decline following years of <a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/analysis-president-trumps-fy-2021-budget-request">budget cuts</a> from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. As that availability continues to decline, a growing number of low-income families contribute a <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/what-causes-homelessness/housing/">larger percentage</a> of their income towards housing annually, increasing their vulnerability to housing instability and homelessness. Nationwide, 8 million people currently spend <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/what-causes-homelessness/housing/">over half</a> of their income on housing. </p>
  <p>Conceptualizing the severity of the housing crisis in DC requires comparisons to national trends, as persisting gaps in state-wide data collection in Maryland and Virginia make it difficult to offer comprehensive comparison at the city or ward level. Taking a closer look at a city like Baltimore, we see parallel issues: nearly <a href="https://www.hchmd.org/homelessness-baltimore">half</a> of all renters spend 35% or more of their income on rent while <a href="https://www.hchmd.org/homelessness-baltimore">25%</a> of residents live at or below the national poverty line. One critical challenge— we don’t know exactly how many people are experiencing homelessness. The “<a href="https://www.hchmd.org/homelessness-baltimore">point in time</a>” methodology— utilized by most of the studies cited here— count only in certain areas of cities and during certain hours, and follows the narrow definitions of homelessness set by HUD. </p>
  <h3>Most Minority Groups Make Up a Larger Share of the Homeless Population than They Do of the General Population</h3>
  <p>Race and ethnicity of those experiencing homelessness compared with the general population</p>
  <img class="body graph" src="img/1-2-1-figure-2.png" alt="Black, mixed race, Native American, Hispanic and Pacific Islander populations make up more of the homeless population than they do of the general population">
  <p>Homelessness encapsulates how interconnected the SDGs truly are— it demonstrates the detrimental intersections between poverty, the labor market, access to transportation, housing, gender equity, healthcare, and racial justice. As such, there is no simple solution— increasing the availability of affordable housing is only a preliminary step. Economic stability and mobility will require a holistic approach to poverty, one that considers how the dimensions of race and gender factor in, alongside geography, urban planning, proximity to decent wages, and affordability of health services. </p>
  <p>With the availability of new census data by 2022 (further contextualizing the impact of the pandemic on long-term poverty trends), in addition to new partnerships with direct services providers in cities across the National Capital Area, our aim is to (1) fill in the data gaps for cities in Virginia and Maryland, (2) develop and report a shared methodology across stakeholder groups for evaluating the driving factors of homelessness,  and (3) produce a more granular comparison across geographies of how these multifaceted challenges interact with one another.</p>
