<h2>Poverty and SNAP Relational Map: UNA-NCA Jurisdiction</h2>
<iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="SNAP x Poverty DMV Map" src="//americanu.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=016121750a8c4338a6e2ed87169b31dc&extent=-85.913,34.1611,-73.2238,40.8464&home=true&zoom=true&previewImage=false&scale=true&legend=true&disable_scroll=false&theme=light"></iframe>
<p>
  The above map depicts the relationship between poverty and SNAP benefits using American Community Survey data points: percent of total population whose income in the past 12 months is below the poverty level and percentage of population with Food Stamp/SNAP benefits in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>Pink, from light to dark, represents poverty from low to high while blue represents SNAP benefits. Together, we can see the relationship between the two variables, i.e. dark blue represents where both variables are high, the purple in the center of the legend represents medium levels of both, and so on. High values are defined as 15% or higher, medium as 7.5-14.9%, and low as 0-7.4%.</p>
<p>Special attention should be paid to the areas on the map where the percentage of the total population whose income is below the poverty level is higher than the percentage of population with Food Stamps/SNAP benefits represented by medium pink, dark pink, and dark purple. These areas, located only in Virginia within the jurisdiction, could indicate underserved populations in need of SNAP benefits facing barriers to access (more on this in 1.3.1). </p>
