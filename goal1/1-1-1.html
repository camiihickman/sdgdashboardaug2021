      <div id="content">
      <p>The international poverty line does not capture the reality of inequity within the United States. In 2015, the poverty line was raised to $1.90 a day, and is intended to “<a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/international-poverty-line-has-just-been-raised-190-day-global-poverty-basically-unchanged-how-even">reflect the standards of absolute poverty in the world’s poorest countries</a>” by establishing a benchmark of both status and progress towards poverty amelioration.  There is significant debate surrounding the value—and potential <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/poverty/news/2020/03/05/481314/poverty-line-matters-isnt-capturing-everyone/">detriment</a>—of a poverty line, but it's intentional omission on this dashboard reflects that fact this measure does not accurately capture the number of people living without access to basic services, security, employment opportunity, and food access across the US. </p>
