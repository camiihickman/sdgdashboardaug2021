        <p>Wealth across the National Capital Area is concentrated geographically-- and also racially. Mean per capita income, disaggregated by race, presents a compelling visual when mapped across Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. As of 2016, the median household income for Black and African American residents in DC is <a href="https://www.dcfpi.org/all/economic-inequality-in-dc-reflects-disparities-in-income-wages-wealth-and-economic-mobility-policy-solutions-should-too/">less than one third</a> of the median household income for white residents. Poverty is dictated by a number of factors, including access to gainful employment and regional cost of living. Accounting for why a larger percentage of Black families in DC live in poverty than in Maryland cannot be reduced merely to the high cost of living in the District — one of the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/10/americas-10-most-expensive-states-to-live-in-2019.html">most expensive cities</a> in the country. Race and income are inextricably linked to one another, and to urban planning — our modern day communities are the <a href="https://medium.com/una-nca-snapshots/building-inclusive-cities-sustainable-urban-development-7cdacb3eb736">legacies</a> of patterns of disinvestment, gentrification, and exclusionary housing policy. This leaves us in a reality where higher-income families are predominantly white and are concentrated within the same neighborhoods and, by extension, counties or Wards. The inverse is the concentration of poverty in urban and suburban regions. Our team hypothesizes that whiter neighborhoods are wealthier in part due to greater proximity to gainful employment — the <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/racial-wage-gaps-persistence-poses-challenge.aspx">racial pay gap</a> is well documented and in part <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/">linked</a> to implicit racial and gender biases among employers and that lower shares of Black and Hispanic residents are college educated (more on why in <a href="../goal4/index.html">SDG 4</a>). However, there needs to be further investigation into the opportunity gap, wherein bias, education, and geography coalesce to shape both the demographics and wealth gaps in our communities. </p>
